The system captures hand movements through a camera or depth sensor and uses computer vision techniques to detect and track hand gestures. Machine learning algorithms, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), are used to classify different gestures. The system can be used in various applications, including virtual reality, augmented reality, robotics, gaming, and human-computer interaction.
